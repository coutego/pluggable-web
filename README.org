* What
~pluggable-web~ is a collection of pluggable plugins to develop web
applications + a sample application to show how the development model works. 
This library is in its very early stages.

* Setup
This library includes a minimal sample web application. The project uses the
libraries ~injectable~ and ~pluggable~ for which there are no packaged releases
yet. For the time being, you need to checkout those three projects in the same
local directory, since ~pluggable-web~ directly references the source files
("../injectable/src" and "../pluggable/src").

Once you have downloaded the three projects, you will need to do an ~npm install~
and then a ~lein dev~. That should launch the web application on port 8280 and
the shadow-cljs console on port 9630.
